I found assignment 3 a lot more straightforward than the previous ones
It was also very interesting learning how services like AWS S3 authentication sign ins using javascript 
and the methods of authentication they use like SHA1
However, I found it difficult finding information regarding how sign ins would differ on different machines for AWS.
